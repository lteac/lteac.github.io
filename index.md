## Platform for Evaluating Language Technology

Developing any type of human language technology is a challenging task.
A contributing factor to this relates to the fact that language technology can
draw from a number of distinct areas of knowledge.

From a more practical perspective, an obstacle to
implementing and adopting language technology relates
to evaluating its performance.
While many large organizations might have budgets sufficient
to allow for extended testing of a number of approaches and products,
most groups spend time they do not have trying track the output of a system.
The Platform for Evaluating Language Technology, or PELT, aims to provide a
platform to help researchers and other organizations evaluate language technology.

The PELT platform and its accompanying documentation is in the process
of being fully released to the open source community through GitHub.
Over the coming weeks documentation, code, and examples will be available for use by any one with the aim of complete availability by May 2016.
